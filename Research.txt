Terms:
	Elo rating - The rating given to a player to define their skill in a meaningful way.
	Elo accelration - The idea that by winning a game you impact both a first order and second order rate of change to your elo rating. The more you lose in a row the more impact it will have on your rating. Good for getting new accounts to where they belong faster.
	Elo gap - The 

Thoughts:	
	- Users will not just be added at the start in one big bulk as that's unrealistic. Each user will join the queue at a different time.
	- The system should ramp up the number of users over time.
	- Priority queue, when checking for players to add to a game, check the priority pool first. 
		- Maybe we added X amount of time to there current waiting time?
		- If they connect to a game and it fails do they really need extra time added though. They should be significantly far up the list.
	-Do we consider combining game pools?
	- Figure out how tail end players are impacted by time priority with the elo gap extending as time goes on.
	- Elo gap should have max value maybe? One Standard distribution away?
	- What can be abused

Implementation Ideas:
	- Small chunks of players with similar ratings to each other grouped togeter?
	- Have a queue where we can reinsert in O(1) time.
		- This might add overhead but if we follow dota's lead where the player is added to a group of ten we need to add and remove them from the queue depending on the game. The other option is to flag a user as 
			- Exmaple: All players accept the game, but one player does not successfully connect in time, we need to put those users in a priority position.
	- A user will be pulled out when a server that host another game is open. Therefore we only need as many games open as there are servers. 



Data structures:
	- What kind of data structure do we use to keep track of time in queue, elo rating, and current elo width.
